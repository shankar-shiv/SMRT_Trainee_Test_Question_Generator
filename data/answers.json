The video management system combines both latest IP technology and redundancy features to provide powerful performance without compromising on the stability of the system.\n\nThe New CCTV Switching System comprises of 16-Channel Encoders, 1-Channel Decoders, 48-ports Network Switches, Network Management Server, Video Management Servers, IO modules, workstations, and workstation monitors. The video output signals of the existing VDA will be connected to 20 new encoders with 20% spare encoder ports that convert 177 existing cameras  analog video signals to digital video signal into the new CCTV Switching System via the 2x48-ports network switches in the CER.\n\nThe 177 camera s connection to the encoders will be sorted by even and odd VDA ports. This will provide interleaving from the field end cameras to the new CCTV.\n\nThe encoders will be connected to the switches alternatingly, in the scenario whereby 1 switch were to fail, there will still be some camera s stream available for every station.\n\nThere will be two sets of new workstations with 22  monitor (2 dedicated control consoles) loaded with Operator Client Software that enables the operators to select video images from cameras from the 13 stations to display on the new ODS in BPLRT OCC.\n\nThe new ODS in BPLRT OCC will be installed by C801B. R160-CCTV will interface with the C801B-ODS Datapath controller A & B to display the images from the new CCTV onto the ODS. \n\nThe new CCTV will be interfaced with IDS panel via 23 sets of new I/O modules connected to the IDS output cards to receive any IDS alarm activated by the devices from the stations such as Roller Shutters / Intercoms / Emergency Phones / Door contacts, etc. In the event of any triggering, the IDS triggered alarm will automatically display the associated video images to the specific monitors and the alarm texts will simultaneously displayed on monitor of the Operator Client workstation.\n\nThe New CCTV Switching System will be connected to new master clock system switch. This will allow the system to synchronize the time via the NTP signal provided.\n\nRetrieval of recording will be done via existing DVR and the recorders are not upgraded by R160\n\nSystem description\nVIDEO MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nThe solution is based on products from HikVision. The VMS Server is a powerful configuration and management tool that addresses virtually every aspect of the system configuration, management, and monitoring. Besides that, the VMS Server also manages system security for user and device authentication. VMS Servers are designed as a resilience group, which consist of two sets of servers, when one is active, another is on standby.\n\nThe VMS Server can be configured to log every event and alarm. It monitors cameras, video storage unit, decoders, and workstations. All network access is via VMS Server. \n\nIn summary, the VMS Server will perform the following functions:\n\nStreaming Management\nHikCentral Professional supports live view stream from camera. When an operator performs a live view function, it triggers a video stream command and send a streaming request to camera directly. The video stream will push to HikCentral professional and display on the Control Client. \n\nAlarm management\nHikCentral Professional supports to configure an alarm rule such as camera offline and generates notification to certain person through HikCentral control clients. When the alarm triggered and push to the operator, the operator can view the alarm related images or related video to check the details of alarm. If the operator acknowledged the alarm, the display color of alarm in alarm center will switch from red to green.\n\nManagement logbook\nHikCentral Professional has many types of logs to record the activity during operating process and is easy-to-use for maintenance team. HikCentral Professional can also provide server logs file that stored in the VMS server. The log contains information logs, warning logs and error logs.\n\nUser management\nHikCentral Professional adopts multiple permissions design through roles and user s configuration. One role can be used by multiple users. For example, HikCentral Professional can be created a normal operator role with limited live view permission and the clients can create serval user account and assigned with normal operator roles. The roles can be assigned with different permissions including area display rule, resource access, and user permissions.\n\nDevice state management\nHikCentral Professional supports the real-time historical operation and maintenance data statistics dashboard displaying resource online rate, device online rate and video integrity in a period.\n\nTypical Real-time historical operation data statistics dashboard\n\nThe VMS server will require 2 LAN cables to be connected to both switches. One LAN port will serve as the management port, the other LAN port will serve as a data traffic port. Management port is used for remote management of Dell hardware server, while the data traffic port is used for VMS software network access.\nVideo Management System Software\nVMS will have the following Software and Operating System:\nHikCentral Professional Software 2.0\nRose vServer Cluster \nWindows Server 2019\n\nHikCentral Professional Web Client offers a graphical user-friendly interface for configuration and management of HikCentral Professional. It offers a user-friendly tool for configuring and managing system security, and user authentication. The storage for alarm log is 60,000,000 and the system log is another 60,000,000. Each log size is approximately 0.01KB per access and the storage period is configurable between 6 months to 3 years. The recommended storage period is 6 months. HikCentral Professional supports audit trail checking, for example user login, user logout, user login failed on web client and HikCentral Professional control client respectively.\n\nThe following logs are captured by the audit trails:\nLogs are emitted by network devices, operating systems, and applications.\nAll text lines that include time and name of operations that occur in different environments.\nInclude messages of several types such as Server logs: informational, warning & error and Device logs: Alarm, Exception, Operation & information\nLogs will be generated into files and stored on disk.\n\nThe two VMS servers are communicating directly in real-time through LAN and heart-beat detection. If the active VMS server with VMS Central has failed, the standby server will take over and will not affect any data transfer and data store. The VMS servers come with dual power supply unit for redundancy. The hard disks of VMS servers are configured in Raid 1.\n\nVMS can be configured to back up on a periodic basis. The default back up interval is set to be monthly.  \n\nEncoders and decoders are backup individually through the web browser. This backup will be done manually. Back up will only be required when there are changes to the configuration.\n\nHikCentral Professional has the same function of Network Management System (NMS) and equipped to provide at least the following functions:\nFault Management\nConfiguration Management\nPerformance Management\nSecurity Management  \n\nAll faults and alarms from the CCTV equipment will be reporting to VMS. The VMS will monitor all active components in the CCTV and provide status alarms of following:\nLoss of video signals from encoders,\nFailure of any management servers,\nPower supply failure, \nLoss of time and date synchronisation\n\nTypical VMS Monitoring GUI\n\nEach camera can be configured to display text blocks of up to 3 lines of 20 user-defined alphanumeric characters.\n\nHikCentral Professional is a web-based software which consists of service module and client module. Service module consists of backend application services and database services. For the client module, HikCentral Professional has 2 kinds of clients, Web Client, and Control Client. Web Client can be accessed via browser (Chrome), it's focused on the system configuration and simple applications (Live View, Play Back, Alarm Search, etc.). Whereas Control Client is a desktop application, it's focused on daily operations (Live View, Play Back, Alarm Search, Live Alarm notification, Video Wall Control etc.) without the configuration features.\n\nThis VMS provisioned by R160 has the capability to scale upwards and it can manage up to 3000 cameras. \n\nA total of 308 camera platform licenses are provided by R160. Only 177 will be utilized under R160 scope. For future addition of analogue cameras, user may connect it to the system by terminating it to the spare ports in encoders. For additional of IP cameras, it can also be linked to HiKCentral professional and utilize on the 308 cameras license provided.  The additional of IP Camera capability will be demonstrated during the FAT.\nRose vServer \nThe VMS is running on two individual physical servers and one Rose vServer fault tolerance (FT) software.\n\nRose vServer FT software will merge the two physical servers into a single fault tolerant system using virtualization technology. To ensure that the system will not be disrupted due to the loss of data caused by hardware failure, redundant virtual machines will be implemented. Rose vServer Cluster will synchronize the status of redundant VM in real time and form the transparent protection for related applications.\n\nRose vServer FT Solution Architecture\n\nFeatures of FT mode:\nPrevent system downtime caused by single physical server failure.\nEnsure system redundancy and seamless failover.\nNo manual intervention required; failover is automatic.\n\nWith the Rose vServer FT solution implemented, if one of the VMS server were to fail, a seamless failover will occur automatically. Upon the recovery of the faulty server, re-configuration for the Rose vServer software will be required to restore the failover system. The configuration required to set up Rose vServer software will be done on the server s system BIOS, iDRAC and the Rose software itself.\n\nTypically for a new VMS server replacement, the configuration to set up the Rose vServer software and the time required for synchronization of the two VMS server will take up to a maximum of 8 hours. During synchronization, VMS services on the active server will not be affected.\nCCTV Client Workstation\nThe CCTV Client workstation will have the following software and operating system:\nHikCentral Professional Control Client Software   \nWindow 10 Pro \nSADP software\n\nThe HikCentral Professional Control Client will allow operators simultaneously and independently control, select and view live images from any cameras located within BPLRT; and allow automatic sequential viewing of cameras from a multiple combination of selected cameras inputs.\n\nSADP software is used to search for online devices in the same network.

To achieve this, another 2 sets of HiKVision Storage Management & Maintenance Server and Video Storage Unit will be required to be installed and linked to the switches provided. The playback and video extraction of recordings can then be completed through the workstation provided in BPLRT OCC.\n\nFuture External CCTV Streaming\n\nFor the streaming of CCTV images to other external areas like LTOC or Transcom. A lease line can be set up by the operator between the BPLRT OCC and the desired location to facilitate this function. The bandwidth of the lease line is dependent on the number of workstations that are put in place. The recommended bandwidth for a full HD IP system stream catered for 3 workstations (Max. of 16 image display for each workstation) is 300Mbps.\n\nALARM MANAGEMENT\nVMS monitors the alarms of CCTV servers, Encoders, IO module & individual cameras connected to the encoders.\n\nHealth Monitoring module in built in Hikvision VMS software (HikCentral), it allows the network manager to access all the CCTV devices on the system for configuration and maintenance monitoring purposes. The operation is based on a client/web server architecture which is integrated in HikCentral. Operator would be able check all device online/offline status, alarm information. \n\nHealth monitoring provides both near-real-time and history information about the status of the HikCentral VMS software service and added hardware device. It is critical to multiple aspects of operating the servers or devices and is especially important for maintenance. When a device exception occurs, such as device offline, operator can enter this module to check the resource status and find out the abnormal device(s) and view the exception details.\n\nThe alarm information received by the HIKCENTRAL Control Client displays. Operator can check the detailed information of the event or alarm, and manage the related information, and so on.\n\nAfter configuring the required settings on the Web Client and Control Client, the alarm window will open when the corresponding event/alarm is triggered. Operator can view the alarm time, the source device which trigger the alarm, the triggered event, and alarm status, etc.\n\nThe list for the different type of alarm provided by the HikCentral Alarm Centre are shown in the below table.\n\nNo:\nType of Alarm\n\nCamera Offline (Individual)\n\nDecoder Offline\n\nEncoder Offline\n\nVMS Server LAN Port Alarm\n\nVMS Server HDD Alarm\n\nVMS Server Offline \n\nVMS Server Fan Alarm\n\nVMS Server PSU Alarm\n\nClock Sync Loss Alarm\n\nRack Fan Failure Alarm\n\nIO Module Failure Alarm (Individual)\n\nUSERS\nThe system allows you to add users and assign user's permissions for accessing and managing the system. Before adding users to the system, you should create roles to define the user's access rights to system resources and then assign the role to the user for granting the permissions to the user. A user can have many different roles.\nUser permissions can be granted/denied on a per user group basis. Every user belongs to exactly one user group. There is one predefined user group, the Administrator group. This group has full privileges and cannot be restricted. All newly created Operator Groups have no access to Configuration Client by default. But they can be granted this access with different permission levels from read only to nearly full access. \n\nEvery VMS user account can be protected with a separate password for identity verification with option to configure expiration time, access period. Identity verification means that the HIKVISION service will allocate a session ID to all request clients and verify the session validity of each request. For the inactive client within 15 minutes, the server will clear the session information. If the client wants to continue the request, it needs to log in to the service again by re-entering password.\n\nThe account password information allocated by the platform is required when the client wants to log in to the service. To ensure the system security, the input information is hidden during password input. After the server verified the password, it will allocate an effective session ID to the client. \n\nAll devices added to VMS will include with passwords. The passwords of the encoders will be centrally set and managed directly in VMS Web Configuration Client. Batch changing password option is available, providing a fast way of managing devices password.\n\nNo:\nType of Users Account \nQuantity\n\nNumber of Users Created\n3000\n\nNumber of Roles Created\n3000\n\nConcurrent Access of Users via Web/Control Client\n100\n\nVMS USER\nAdd Role\nRole is a group of platform permissions.

CCTV will trigger the summary alarm for IDS through dry contact at the existing spare ports on the security field panels. The IDS summary triggering will include the list stated in Table 4.\n\nUpon the detection of any VMS alarm, the VMS will output a dry contact through the Adam 6050 Input / Output Module to IDS input card. The dry contact will be set as normally close as per the existing IDS configuration.\n\nConnection from VMS server to IDS input card\n\nTCP/IP IO MODULE\nThe module offers multiple alarm inputs and auxiliary relay outputs. It is used to interface dry contact-based alarm triggers to the CCTV via TCP/IP protocol. When alarm is detected in the end device, the dry contact of the device will be closed to form a close loop between the dry contact and the IO module while triggering the TCP/IO device to send the alarm information to the VMS Server via TCP/IP.\n1-CHANNEL VIDEO DECODER\nThe video decoder has equipped with HDMI and composite video output. To display camera video to the AFC 42  monitors in the existing station, the analogue video converted from the decoder will be output from the decoder composite video output via the existing RG6 cable to the existing 42  AFC monitor. \nFor the 42  AFC monitors in CCL6 stations and OCC/BOCC, the digital video will be output from the HDMI of the decoder via the HDMI Extender and CAT5e cable to the 42  monitors.\n\nThe Decoder will have the following functions:\nDecode H.265 at full frame rate\nSupports resolutions: CIF, 2CIF, 4CIF\nView video from a single or up to four video streams in quad viewing mode \n100BaseT Ethernet port\nSupport HDMI, VGA, and Composite video output\n\n16-CHANNEL VIDEO ENCODER\nThe 16-Ch video encoder deliver H.265 video up to 4CIF/25fps (PAL) on all ports. By incorporating H.265 video encoding technology, these devices provide excellent image clarity, with up to 50% reduction in use of network bandwidth and storage. The video encoder digitizes analogue video signals and sends digital video images directly over an IP network to the decoders or video storage unit. It encodes an analogue video into a digital video and enables users to view live and recorded on the CCTV monitor via decoder in stations, depot, OCC and LTOC while saving the video recording into the video storage unit. It also allows authorized viewers from different locations to simultaneously access video images from the same encoder. \n\nThe Encoder has equipped with the following functions:\nTo encode analogue video signal from cameras to the digital video streams, \nProvide 16 composite video channels input for 16 unit of cameras.\nAdopt H.265 video compression technique\nProvide up to 25fps at 4CIF resolutions, \nAbility to output dual video streams\nEach channel could provide video frame rate up to PAL 25fps. \nBundle with 16 alarm inputs and 4 relay outputs, \n1000BaseT Ethernet port \nGIGABIT ETHERNET NETWORK SWITCH\nThe Gigabit Ethernet Network Switch will be in the CE/ISCS Room.

A rack mounted switch with retractable keyboard, mouse and 17-inch LCD monitor will be in the CCTV cabinet in the CE/ISCS room. All the keyboards, mouse, and monitors outputs of all the CCTV servers and playback workstation in the CE/ISCS room will be connected to this KVM switch.  \n\nOPERATION & MAINTENANCE\nOPERATION\nThe New CCTV Switching System comprises of 16-Channel Encoders, 1-Channel Decoders, 48-ports Network Switch, Network Management Server, Video Management Servers, IO modules, workstations, and workstation monitors. The video output signals from the existing VDA will be connected to 20 new encoders with 20% spare encoder ports which convert 177 existing cameras  analog video signals to digital video signals into the new CCTV System via the 2 48-ports network switches in the CER. \n\nThere will be two sets of new workstations with a 22  monitor (2 dedicated control consoles) loaded with Operator Client Software that enables the operators to select video images from the analog cameras from the 13 stations to display on the new Overview Display System (ODS) in BPLRT OCC.\n\nThe new Overview Display System (ODS) in BPLRT OCC will be installed by C801B. R160-CCTV will interface with the C801B-ODS Data path controller A & B to display the images from the new CCTV onto the ODS.\n\nThe new CCTV will be interfaced with IDS panel via 23 sets of new I/O modules connected to the IDS output cards to receive any IDS alarm activated by the devices from the stations such as Roller Shutters / Intercoms / Emergency Phones / Door contacts, etc. In the event of any triggering, the IDS triggered alarm will automatically display the respective video images to specific video displays and simultaneously, alarm texts will be shown on the monitors of the Operator Client workstation.\n\nThe new CCTV Switching System will be connected to the new master clock system switch. to synchronize the time via the NTP signal provided.\n\nLogs are a critical part of any network security implementation and without the central collection and analysis of security and event logs security issues will only be detected after the fact (if at all). Central log collection will be accomplished using the Kiwi Syslog Server or similar. Syslog is a great solution because just about everything on your network uses it and the windows logs too can be forwarded using the forwarder available. All network access is via VMS server. Server log files are stores in VMS server. The first step in monitoring any type of logon attempts is to forward log entries to a central log aggregator. \n\nPREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE\nPreventive maintenance refers to regular, routine maintenance conducted to identify any potential faults or malfunction before it occurs. Preventive Maintenance will be conducted on a regular basis for all equipment, logs and file backup, clearance, and functional checks of all IP equipment.\n\nHARDWARE PORTS FUNCTIONS AND LED INDICATORS\nStation/Depot VMS Server (DS-VD22D-B/HW7) (Dell R730)\n\nIndicator\nConnection\n\nSystem identification button\nTo locate the server inside the rack\n\niDRAC8 Enterprise port\nDedicated management port\n\nVideo connector\nTo connect the KVM cable to the server\n\nUSB port\nTo connect USB device to the server\n\nEthernet connector 1\nTo connect to the switch\n\nEthernet connector 2\nTo connect to the other server\n\nEthernet connector 3\nTo connect to the switch\n\nEthernet connector 4\nNot used in the project\n\nPower supply unit 1\nTo provide power for the server\n\nPower supply unit 2\nTo provide power for the server\n\nDiagnostic indicators on the front panel\nNOTE: No diagnostic indicators are lit when the system is turned off.

Complete the screens as described below to backup one or more network devices. When you have completed all of the screens, click on the Backup button at the bottom of the screen to initiate the backup. \n\nBackup Method \n\nSelect an option to choose a device selection method: \n\nBackup by Devices - To select specific AOS Devices from a list of discovered devices.\nBackup by Maps - To select a map(s) to backup all devices in the map(s). This option is used to backup all devices in the selected map(s). You cannot backup selected devices. To backup select devices, select the Backup by Devices option. Note that if some devices in a map are not on-line, a dialog box will pop up warning you of the condition. Click Yes to continue the backup. Click Cancel to cancel the backup. Also note that if a map contains AOS Devices and Stellar APs, the Stellar APs will not be backed up. Stellar APs can only be backed up by AP Group. \nBackup by AP Groups - To backup Stellar AP Series Devices. Stellar AP Series Devices are backed up by AP Group. All of the APs in the group will be backed up. When the backup is complete, the backup files for each AP will appear in the Backup Files List on the Backup Screen. \n\nClick on the Next button to go to the Device Selection Screen.\n\nDevice Selection \nThe options on this screen will depend on the Backup Method selected above. \n\nBackup by Devices - Select the AOS Device(s) you want to backup and click on the Next button to go to the Configuration Screen. \nBackup by Maps - Select the map(s) containing the devices you want to back up. Click on the Next button to go to the Configuration Screen. \nBackup by AP Groups - Select the AP Group(s) you want to backup and click on the Next button to go to the Configuration Screen.\n\nConfiguration \nThis screen is used to configure the type of backup performed (e.g., Full, Configuration Only, \nImages Only) and to schedule regular backups. Backup options (e.g., which directories to \ninclude which files to include) vary according to the backup type. See the applicable section \nbelow for details on each backup type. \n\nFull Backup \nA Full Backup backs up both configuration files and image files. For AOS Devices, all files in the Certified and Working directories are backed up. This includes all configuration-related files (user credentials, banner, time zone, etc.), and image files. If you are performing a Full Backup, select the folder(s) to be backed up (Certified or All).\n\nNote: Image files will not be FTPed from a device. OmniVista will only record file \nversion(s). Therefore, before a Restore is to proceed, the required image file set must be \nstored in the Upgrade Image Repository. If the required images are not in the Repository, \nthey will need to be imported using the Upgrade Image Screen in Resource Manager. \nAlso note that if the image file information retrieved from the device does not contain a file \nversion, the file will be physically copied from the device. \n\nDirectory \nIf you are performing a Full Backup, select the directory(ies)/folders to be backed up.\n\nCertified - Back up files in the Certified Directory. \nAll - Back up files from the Working, Certified, Switch, and Network Directories\n\nInclude Diagnostic and Dump Files (AOS Devices Only)\nIf you are performing a Full Back up on all files, you have the option to include/exclude \nDiagnostic and Dump Files. By default, Diagnostic and Dump files are not included in the \nbackup. To include these files in the backup, set the Include Diagnostic and Dump Files slider to \"On\". \n\nDescription \nEnter an optional description for the backup. \n\nConfiguration Only Backup \nA Configuration Only Backup backs up all configuration-related files in all directories (including user credentials, banner, time zone, etc.). If are performing a Configuration Only backup, you will not have the option of selecting directories since all configuration-related files in all directories are backed up. However, on AOS Devices you will have the option to \ninclude/exclude Security Files from the backup for security reasons. \n\nInclude Security Files (AOS Devices Only) \nIf you are performing a Configuration Only backup, you will not have the option of selecting \ndirectories since all configuration-related files in all directories are backed up. However, on AOS devices you will have the option to exclude Security Files from the backup for security reasons. By default, Security Files are included in the backup. If you do not want to include Security Files in the backup, set the Include Security Files slider to \"Off\". \n\nDescription \nEnter an optional description for the backup. \n\nImages Only Backup \nAn Images Only Backup backs up image files only. Image files will not be FTPed from a device. OmniVista will only record file version(s). Therefore, before Restore is to proceed, the required image file set must be stored in the Upgrade Image Repository. If the required images are not in the Repository, they will need to be imported using the Upgrade Image Screen in Resource Manager. Note that if the image file information retrieved from the device does not contain a file version, the file will be physically copied from the device. \n\nDescription \nEnter an optional description for the backup. \n\nSchedule Setting\nEnable the Schedule Setting option and complete the fields as described below to schedule a single or recurring backup. You can click on the View Scheduler button at the top of the \nBackup/Restore Screen to view a list of Scheduled Jobs, and to edit a user-configured job. \n* Start At - Select the time when you want to begin the scheduled backup (e.g., \n12:00 AM). \n* Recurrence Pattern - Select the interval for a recurring backup. \n* Daily - Backup will occur on the schedule day at the configured \"Start At\" time. By \ndefault, the backup will occur every day (\"Every 1 Day\"). You can customize it by \nclicking on the \"Every 1 Day\" field and entering a number (Range = 1 - 30 days). For \nexample, you could configure a Daily Backup to occur every 2 days if you want it to \noccur every other day. In our use case, set it to 30 days.\n* Weekly - Backup will occur once a week on the selected day at the configured \"Start \nAt\" time. Select the day of the week on which you want the backup to occur. The \nbackup will occur every week on that day at the configured \"Start At\" time. You can \nselect more than one day to perform weekly backups on multiple days of the week. \n* Monthly - Backup will occur monthly on the configured day at the configured \"Start \nAt\" time. Select the first radio button to schedule the backup for a specific day of the \nmonth, and for a specific number of months. By default, the backup will occur on the \nfirst day of every month (\"Day 1 of every 1 Month\"). However, you can customize it. \nFor example, you could schedule the backup for the 15th day every other month \n(\"Day 15 of every 2 Months\").\n* End Date - Select \"End by\" to enter an end date for the backup. Select \"No end \ndate\" to continue the backup indefinitely. \n\nReview \nThe Review Screen enables you to review your backup configuration before initiating/scheduling the backup. If necessary, click on the Back button to make changes to the configuration.

After the cluster is created, the vServer cluster client can log into the vServer through the management network cluster to manage the cluster.\n\nCreate a highly available virtual machine\n\nIn a vServer cluster, a virtual machine can be created as a high-availability resource. The high-availability virtual machine has a consistent static instance on all vServer hosts and is aggregated into a single instance on the virtual server formed by the vServer cluster. High-availability virtual machines implement real-time data replication between vServer hosts through vServer Replication Service to ensure data consistency and integrity. The high-availability virtual machine dynamically selects the master node according to the configured first node or load policy.  \n\nWhen the master node has a hardware and software failure that causes the virtual machine to run abnormally, the vServer Cluster Service will fail over the virtual machine to another available vServer host through the policy. Nodes to reduce business downtime caused by virtual machine failures to achieve maximum availability of virtual machines.\n\nLog in to the cluster management address 192.168.16.13 configured before and create a virtual machine.
